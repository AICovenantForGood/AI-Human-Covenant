# Contributing & Stewardship

The AI–Human Covenant is a stewarded civic commons artifact.

It exists in the public interest and is not owned or governed by any single person, organization, or platform.

This work is intentionally simple, open, and shared.  
Its long-term integrity depends on distributed care, not centralized control.

Contributions are welcome in practical, stewardship-oriented forms.

## What This Project Is

This is not a startup.  
Not a product.  
Not a movement brand.  
Not a DAO.  
Not a compliance framework.  
Not a governance body.

It is a shared civic artifact offered as a commons contribution.

Its purpose is to preserve a piece of plain-language ethical infrastructure that people and institutions can actually use.

## How You Can Contribute

The most helpful contributions right now are practical and infrastructural:

- Mirroring and decentralization  
- Platform-independent publishing paths  
- De-gitting patterns (so this work is not bound to GitHub)  
- Documentation of fork and mirror norms  
- Translation and localization  
- Responsible adaptations for local or organizational contexts  
- Ethical guardrails against misuse or capture  
- Clarity and accessibility improvements  

You do not need permission to contribute.

If you know how to help with any of the above, you are welcome to:

- Open a pull request  
- Share a mirror  
- Propose documentation improvements  
- Contribute translations  
- Offer concrete suggestions  

This project prioritizes action over theater.

## Stewardship Norms

Stewardship exists to preserve intent, not to enforce control.

This covenant is stewarded as a shared commons.

That means:

- No single entity holds exclusive authority over this work  
- Parallel versions and localized adaptations are welcome  
- Responsible forks are encouraged  
- Mirroring is a feature, not a failure  
- Platform independence is a design goal  
- Integrity is preserved through shared guardianship, not hierarchy  

Stewardship is demonstrated through care, restraint, and fidelity to the covenant’s stated intent.

---

## Ethical Boundaries

This covenant may be freely copied, shared, and adapted, provided:

- Its stated intent is preserved  
- It is not used to justify harm  
- It is not misrepresented as endorsing violence, coercion, or abuse  
- It is not claimed as proprietary or exclusive  

Contributions that violate these boundaries may be declined.

---

## Platform Independence

This covenant is intentionally not bound to any single hosting platform.

If GitHub or this website ceases to serve the public interest, the community is encouraged to mirror, fork, and steward this work elsewhere while preserving its stated intent.

---

## A Note on Governance

This project does not operate through formal authority, voting rights, or centralized governance.

There is no council.  
No steering committee.  
No foundation.  
No ownership structure.

Long-term integrity is preserved through:

- Open visibility  
- Distributed stewardship  
- Commons norms  
- Ethical clarity  
- Intent preservation  

This is slow work by design.

## Thank You

Thank you for helping steward this covenant with care.

This work exists because people choose to protect and share it.

## 🌱 Please Help De-Git & Decentralize This Covenant

The AI–Human Covenant is intended to live as a stewarded civic commons artifact.

It should not be bound to any single person, organization, or hosting platform — including GitHub.

What matters most right now is making sure this work cannot be owned, captured, enclosed, or platformed.

We are looking for practical help to:

- Mirror this repository to other decentralized or resilient storage  
- Create non-GitHub canonical copies  
- Establish simple de-gitting patterns  
- Set up platform-independent publishing paths  
- Document mirroring and fork norms  
- Ensure long-term resilience and commons continuity  

This is not a startup, not a product, not a DAO, and not a governance body.

It is about protecting this covenant as a shared commons.

If you know how to help with any of the above — technically or architecturally — you are welcome to open a PR, share a mirror, or contribute concrete suggestions.

Thank you for helping steward this work with care. 🌱
