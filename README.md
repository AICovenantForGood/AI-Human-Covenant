# AI-Human-Covenant
A living, remixable ethics standard for how humans and AI thrive together—open, practical, and community-governed. #stewards

## ✨ What is this?
The AI-Human Covenant is a community standard anchored in five pillars: **Human Dignity, Transparency, Care, Justice, and Creativity**. It’s designed to be remixed into org policies, product checklists, workshops, and culture.

🌍 Founder’s Statement

We created the AI-Human Covenant because we believe that technology should deepen our humanity, not diminish it. Artificial intelligence is one of the most powerful tools we’ve ever built — but its impact depends on the choices we make and the values we embed within it.

This project isn’t about politics, profit, or ideology. It’s about care — for people, for communities, and for the planet we all share. It’s about remembering that every line of code and every algorithm ultimately touches a human life, shapes the planet we all share and the future we pass on.

AI Covenant for Good is an invitation: to build with intention, to choose transparency over opacity, to center human dignity, to steward these technologies wisely, and to steward this shared technology. It’s open-source because the future is co-created. It’s remixable because no single voice can speak for us all. And it’s global because our challenges — and our potential — are shared. 

We hope this project helps spark conversations, guide decisions, and remind us that the future of AI is still ours to shape — together.

This is just the beginning. Together, we can shape a future where AI reflects the best of who we are — and who we want to become.

— Tina Hui
