## 🌱 Help De-Git & Decentralize This Covenant

The AI–Human Covenant is intended to live as a stewarded civic commons artifact.

It should not be bound to any single person, organization, or hosting platform — including GitHub.

What matters most right now is making sure this work cannot be owned, captured, enclosed, or platformed.

We are looking for practical help to:

- Mirror this repository to other decentralized or resilient storage  
- Create non-GitHub canonical copies  
- Establish simple de-gitting patterns  
- Set up platform-independent publishing paths  
- Document mirroring and fork norms  
- Ensure long-term resilience and commons continuity  

This is not a startup, not a product, not a DAO, and not a governance body.

It is about protecting this covenant as a shared commons.

If you know how to help with any of the above — technically or architecturally — you are welcome to open a PR, share a mirror, or contribute concrete suggestions.

Thank you for helping steward this work with care. 🌱
