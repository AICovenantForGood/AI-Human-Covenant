# Anti-Toxic Sludge Action Plan
1) Pause before you share.  
2) Source & signal (cite origin).  
3) Use care filters (mute, block, curate).  
4) Correct with kindness.  
5) Disclose AI/synthetic media.  
6) Spread good karma faster (uplift verified, helpful content).  
7) Report & regenerate (log off, touch nature, reconnect).
