# AI–Human Covenant (v1.0)

The **AI–Human Covenant** is a plain-language declaration of shared commitments for how artificial intelligence should be developed and used in ways that deepen humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

This covenant is offered as an open resource to inspire ethical reflection, policy conversations, and responsible stewardship of AI systems.

## 📜 Covenant Text

### Preamble
We choose to build and use AI in ways that deepen our humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

### Five Pillars
1. **Human Dignity First** — AI serves people; consent and safety by design.  
2. **Transparency & Trust** — provenance, explainability, and auditability.  
3. **Care & Stewardship** — reduce harm; regenerate wellbeing and ecosystems.  
4. **Community & Justice** — fair access, shared benefit, inclusion.  
5. **Creativity & Play** — imagination and culture as core infrastructure.

### Commitments
- Disclose AI-assisted content where relevant.  
- Publish clear accountability: who decides, who benefits, who can appeal.  
- Measure and mitigate harms; document tradeoffs.  
- Invest in accessibility, localization, and community translation.  
- Prefer open standards and portable data where feasible.

> Remix & adapt for your org/community. Keep credits and license.
