# AI–Human Covenant (v1.0)

The **AI–Human Covenant** is a plain-language declaration of shared commitments for how artificial intelligence could and should be developed and used in ways that deepen humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

This covenant is offered as an open resource to inspire ethical reflection, policy conversations, and responsible stewardship of AI systems. This covenant is offered as one practical, stewarded expression within a broader global conversation about human–AI relationships.

It is intended to contribute to, not replace, parallel explorations across disciplines, cultures, and communities.

## 📜 Covenant Text

### Preamble
We choose to build and use AI in ways that deepen our humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

### Five Pillars
1. **Human Dignity First** — AI serves people; consent and safety by design.  
2. **Transparency & Trust** — provenance, explainability, and auditability.  
3. **Care & Stewardship** — reduce harm; regenerate wellbeing and ecosystems.  
4. **Community & Justice** — fair access, shared benefit, inclusion.  
5. **Creativity & Play** — imagination and culture as core infrastructure.

### Commitments
- Disclose AI-assisted content where relevant.  
- Publish clear accountability: who decides, who benefits, who can appeal.  
- Measure and mitigate harms; document tradeoffs.  
- Invest in accessibility, localization, and community translation.  
- Prefer open standards and portable data where feasible.

> Share, remix & adapt for your org/community. Keep credits and license.

Stewardship evolves slowly, guided by demonstrated care, restraint, and alignment with the covenant’s intent.

The stewards may publicly clarify when the covenant is misrepresented or used in ways that violate its stated intent.

## Parallel & Related Work

The language of human–AI covenants is emerging across disciplines, cultures, and communities.

We recognize and welcome thoughtful parallel explorations in psychology, philosophy, policy, design, technology, and the arts.

This covenant is offered as one practical, technical, and civic expression within a broader shared conversation.

We believe convergence, not competition, is how humane futures are built.

If you’re working on related ideas or frameworks, you’re welcome to share references or reflections.
