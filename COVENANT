# AI-Human Covenant (v1.0)

## Preamble
We choose to build and use AI in ways that deepen our humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

## Five Pillars
1. **Human Dignity First** — AI serves people; consent and safety by design.
2. **Transparency & Trust** — provenance, explainability, and auditability.
3. **Care & Stewardship** — reduce harm; regenerate wellbeing and ecosystems.
4. **Community & Justice** — fair access, shared benefit, inclusion.
5. **Creativity & Play** — imagination and culture as core infrastructure.

## Commitments
- Disclose AI-assisted content where relevant.
- Publish clear accountability: who decides, who benefits, who can appeal.
- Measure and mitigate harms; document tradeoffs.
- Invest in accessibility, localization, and community translation.
- Prefer open standards and portable data where feasible.
