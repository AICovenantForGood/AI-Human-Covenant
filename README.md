# AI-Human Covenant

**A living, remixable ethics standard for how humans and AI thrive together — open, practical, and community-governed.**  
Hashtag: **#stewards**

## ✨ What is this?
The AI-Human Covenant is a community standard anchored in five pillars: **Human Dignity, Transparency, Care, Justice, and Creativity**. It’s designed to be remixed into org policies, product checklists, workshops, and culture.

- Anti-Toxic Sludge Playbook: [`/PLAYBOOK/anti-toxic-sludge.md`](PLAYBOOK/anti-toxic-sludge.md)  
- Starter Kit (social + stickers): [`/STARTER-KIT`](STARTER-KIT)

3. **Translate** it — see [`/TRANSLATIONS`](TRANSLATIONS).

## 🧭 Principles (short)

- **Care & Stewardship** — reduce harm, regenerate wellbeing.
- **Community & Justice** — fair access, shared benefit.
- **Creativity & Play** — imagination is infrastructure.
