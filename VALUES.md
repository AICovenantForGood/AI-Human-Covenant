🌍 AI-Human Covenant: Core Values & Principles

Our mission:
To guide the development and use of artificial intelligence in ways that deepen our humanity, protect life, and serve the shared future of people and planet.

🪩 Core Values
💛 Human Dignity

Every person deserves respect, safety, consent, and agency in how technology impacts their lives.

🌱 Stewardship

We are caretakers — of knowledge, ecosystems, communities, and the future. We build as if generations ahead are watching.

🤝 Justice & Inclusion

AI must uplift the many, not just the few — closing gaps, not widening them.

🔍 Transparency & Trust

Explain what we build. Disclose how it works. Invite scrutiny. Trust grows from clarity.

🧠 Creativity & Play

Technology should empower imagination, culture, and joy — not erase them.

🧭 Guiding Principles
1. Humanity First

Technology must serve people, never replace their worth or diminish their dignity.

2. Care by Design

Safety, consent, accessibility, and planetary wellbeing must be designed in — not bolted on.

3. Accountability & Provenance

Be clear about who builds, who benefits, and who can question or appeal. Disclose AI-generated content and data sources.

4. Shared Benefit

Prioritize tools and systems that widen opportunity, reduce inequality, and support thriving communities.

5. Regenerative Impact

Design for long-term flourishing — social, cultural, and ecological — not just short-term gain.

6. Open Collaboration

Knowledge should be remixable, shareable, and collectively improved. We go further when we build together.

7. Continuous Reflection

The covenant evolves as we learn. We invite new voices, new wisdom, and new visions for what AI — and humanity — can become.

💫 Call to Action:
This is more than a framework — it’s a promise. A promise to shape technology in ways that reflect the best of who we are and the future we wish to see.

AI is powerful. Humanity decides how that power is used.
