# AI–Human Covenant (v1.0)

The **AI–Human Covenant** is a plain-language declaration of shared commitments for how artificial intelligence could and should be developed and used in ways that deepen humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

This covenant is offered as an open resource to inspire ethical reflection, policy conversations, and responsible stewardship of AI systems. This covenant is offered as one practical, stewarded expression within a broader global conversation about human–AI relationships.

It is intended to contribute to, not replace, parallel explorations across disciplines, cultures, and communities.

## 📜 Covenant Text

### Preamble
We choose to build and use AI in ways that deepen our humanity, protect dignity, and serve people and planet.

### Five Pillars
1. **Human Dignity First** — AI serves people; consent and safety by design.  
2. **Transparency & Trust** — provenance, explainability, and auditability.  
3. **Care & Stewardship** — reduce harm; regenerate wellbeing and ecosystems.  
4. **Community & Justice** — fair access, shared benefit, inclusion.  
5. **Creativity & Play** — imagination and culture as core infrastructure.

### Commitments
- Disclose AI-assisted content where relevant.  
- Publish clear accountability: who decides, who benefits, who can appeal.  
- Measure and mitigate harms; document tradeoffs.  
- Invest in accessibility, localization, and community translation.  
- Prefer open standards and portable data where feasible.

> Share, remix & adapt for your org/community. Keep credits and license.

## STEWARDSHIP

## Decentralized Stewardship

The AI–Human Covenant is intentionally stewarded as a distributed commons, not owned or governed by a single individual, organization, or platform.

Long-term integrity is best preserved through many aligned stewards holding shared intent, rather than centralized authority.

This means:

- Anyone may fork, translate, adapt, or reference this covenant responsibly  
- Parallel versions and localized adaptations are welcome  
- Stewardship exists to preserve intent, not to enforce control  
- No single entity holds exclusive authority over this work  

The community is invited to help steward this covenant over time through care, translation, documentation, governance reflection, and ethical oversight.

This work is open source.  
Its future is intentionally shared.

## Stewardship as a Commons

The AI–Human Covenant is stewarded as a shared commons.

This means:

- There is no single owner of this work  
- There is no centralized authority  
- There is no exclusive governance body  
- There is no compliance enforcement mechanism  

Stewardship is defined as:

- Preserving the covenant’s core intent  
- Protecting it from misuse to justify harm  
- Maintaining clarity and accessibility  
- Supporting translation and localization  
- Encouraging ethical reflection and dialogue  

Anyone may participate in stewardship through:

- Responsible forks  
- Translations  
- Documentation improvements  
- Governance discussion  
- Parallel framework development  
- Community facilitation  
- Ethical critique

This covenant is intentionally not bound to any single hosting platform.

Active Stewardship is offered, not granted.

Alignment is demonstrated through care, restraint, and fidelity to the covenant’s stated intent.

## 🌱 Help De-Git & Decentralize This Covenant

The AI–Human Covenant is intended to live as a stewarded civic commons artifact.

It should not be bound to any single person, organization, or hosting platform — including GitHub.

What matters most right now is making sure this work cannot be owned, captured, enclosed, or platformed.

We are looking for practical help to:

- Mirror this repository to other decentralized or resilient storage  
- Create non-GitHub canonical copies  
- Establish simple de-gitting patterns  
- Set up platform-independent publishing paths  
- Document mirroring and fork norms  
- Ensure long-term resilience and commons continuity  

This is not a startup, not a product, not a DAO, and not a governance body.

It is about protecting this covenant as a shared commons.

If you know how to help with any of the above — technically or architecturally — you are welcome to open a PR, share a mirror, or contribute concrete suggestions.

Thank you for helping steward this work with care. 🌱


## Active Stewardship

This covenant is stewarded to preserve its intent, tone, and ethical boundaries as a shared commons contribution.

Stewardship is held in service of dignity, care, and human agency — not as authority, ownership, or governance over others.

**Current technical steward:** Tina Hui

Stewardship evolves slowly, guided by demonstrated care, restraint, and alignment with the covenant’s intent.

The stewards may publicly clarify when the covenant is misrepresented or used in ways that violate its stated intent.

Stewardship roles are invitation-only and are extended slowly based on demonstrated care, restraint, and alignment with the covenant’s intent.

## Parallel & Related Work

The language of human–AI covenants is emerging across disciplines, cultures, and communities.

We recognize and welcome thoughtful parallel explorations in psychology, philosophy, policy, design, technology, and the arts.

This covenant is offered as one practical, technical, and civic expression within a broader shared conversation.

We believe convergence, not competition, is how humane futures are built.

If you’re working on related ideas or frameworks, you’re welcome to share references or reflections.
